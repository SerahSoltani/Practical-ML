## Contributing Notebooks

Please consider the following points before proceeding:

* The purpose of Practical Machine Learning is for AI/ML researchers to learn through experimentation on notebooks which, as simply as possible, run through the flow of get data, train and evaluate model and show how to use the model for inference.
* The notebooks are structured around various ML tasks within topics. We should try as much as possible to report the current SOTA on the task as a comparison.
* When you issue a pull request, you agree that your contribution is in the public domain (guided by the [MIT](LICENSE)).
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion or contribution. This allows to better handle updates or comments on the proposed suggestion or contribution.
